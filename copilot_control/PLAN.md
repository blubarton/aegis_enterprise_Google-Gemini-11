# Copilot Control System - Design and Implementation Plan

## Information Gathered

- User has an existing AI repository (Aegis Enterprise / Google Gemini) with no current copilot integration.
- Provided scripts include:
  - CoreAIAgent (Python): basic AI agent with config loading, perception, action, learning, and server connection.
  - TerminalControlNode (Python): runs shell commands, edits and reads files.
  - MCPSystem (Python): node registration and command execution.
  - Command server (Python Flask): REST API for file editing and command execution.
  - Copilot client (Python): client to interact with command server.
- Existing MCP config and connector (TypeScript) provide a secure, modular communication framework with support for HTTP, WebSocket, gRPC, and local connections, including encryption and authentication.
- User wants a production-ready, logically complete system under `copilot_control/` directory.
- The system should enable the AI assistant to perform terminal commands, file edits, and integrate with the existing AI system for testing.

└── utils.py                  # Utility functions (e.g., logging, security helpers)

## Component Design

### Core AI Agent (core_ai_agent.py)
- Load config from JSON file
- Perceive input data (vision, text, etc.)
- Act by issuing commands or file edits via MCP system
- Learn from experiences to update internal state
- Connect to command server or MCP nodes securely
- Main run loop for autonomous operation

### Terminal Control Node (terminal_control_node.py)
- Run arbitrary shell commands with output capture
- Edit files with new content safely
- Read file contents
- Return success/failure status and logs

### MCP System (mcp_system.py)
- Register nodes (e.g., terminal control node)
- Execute node commands by name with arguments
- Manage node lifecycle and communication
- Support secure communication and encryption (inspired by existing MCP connector)

### Command Server (command_server.py)
- Flask-based REST API exposing endpoints:
  - POST /edit: edit file content
  - POST /run: run shell command
- Handle authentication and security (API key or token)
- Log requests and responses
- Support configurable port and concurrency

### Copilot Client (copilot_client.py)
- Python client to send requests to command server
- Functions for edit_file and run_command with error handling
- Support configuration of server URL and authentication

### Utilities (utils.py)
- Logging setup
- Security helpers (e.g., encryption, token generation)
- Config loading helpers

## Security and Communication
- Use API key or token-based authentication for command server
- Optionally support encryption for payloads (future extension)
- Validate inputs to prevent injection or unauthorized access
- Log all operations for audit and debugging

## Follow-up Steps
- Implement each component as per design
- Write unit and integration tests
- Document setup and usage in README.md
- Integrate with existing AI system for testing
- Iterate based on feedback and testing results

Please review this plan and confirm if you approve so I can proceed with implementation.
