## üîë Key Features

- **Quantum-Enhanced Reasoning**: Utilizes quantum entanglement and algorithms to boost cognitive processing.
- **Multi-Component Processing (mCP)**: Flexible JSON-driven configuration supporting HTTP, WebSocket, gRPC, and local protocols.
- **Robust Security**: Cognitive signature authentication replaces traditional API keys, with real-time threat detection.
- **Extensible Node System**: Supports platform, browser, AI enhancement, and language execution nodes.
- **Hybrid Intelligence**: Seamlessly integrates offline and online AI capabilities.
- **Cross-Platform Interfaces**: REST API, WebSocket, CLI, and mobile bridge for Android/iOS.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Deployment Flow

1. **Initialization**: Core system boots quantum processor, security engine, and node manager.
2. **Configuration**: Loads JSON configs for mCP, nodes, and security.
3. **Node Loading**: Registers all nodes (platform, AI, language, browser).
4. **Request Handling**: API or CLI inputs are processed through orchestrator.
5. **Quantum Processing**: Tasks are optimized and secured via quantum processor.
6. **Execution**: Nodes execute tasks and return results.
7. **Response**: Results are returned with cognitive metadata and security signatures.

## üìà Scalability & Security

- Dynamic node registration allows scaling and adding new capabilities.
- Quantum cryptography ensures end-to-end secure communication.
- Cognitive signatures provide keyless, quantum-resistant authentication.
- Threat detection monitors runtime for injection and adversarial patterns.
