Updated Plan to Resolve Repository Problems and TS1110 Errors

Summary:
The TS1110 "Type expected" errors and related typing issues in the repository are primarily due to incomplete or inconsistent type declarations, missing required properties/methods in node classes, and possibly complex nested generic types causing parsing issues.

Key Points:
1. Review and unify all related type declarations and interfaces for completeness and consistency.
2. Ensure all node classes fully implement the BaseNode interface, including the 'input' property and 'process' method with correct typing.
3. Add any missing logic or type annotations that TypeScript expects to resolve parsing errors.
4. Consider creating index files or central type exports to simplify imports and reduce errors.
5. Perform a systematic refactor of all affected files guided by the design and the "To integrate yo.txt" logic.
6. Simplify complex nested generic types where possible to avoid parsing issues.
7. Test critical paths after refactoring to verify correctness and stability.

Additional Notes:
- The wrapper pattern using ContextEnvelope has been adopted to unify input/output types.
- Some node classes (e.g., AndroidNode, IosNode, FileCreationNode) require adding 'input' and 'process' to fully implement BaseNode.
- The TS1110 error on Promise generic syntax can be mitigated by avoiding explicit generic in new Promise constructor.
- Consistent use of interfaces and types across the project will improve maintainability and reduce errors.
- This plan serves as a reference for future refactoring and debugging sessions.

This document can be used as a motto or guiding principle for ongoing and future development to maintain code quality and type safety.

Please keep this plan handy for reference and share it when starting new tasks or chats related to this project.
