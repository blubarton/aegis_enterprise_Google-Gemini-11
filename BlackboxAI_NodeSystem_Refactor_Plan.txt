BlackboxAI Node System Refactor and Enhancement Plan

Objective:
Resolve persistent TypeScript TS1110 "Type expected" errors and related typing/interface implementation issues across all node files in the repository. Improve node logic to fully realize the vision of a powerful AI system capable of operating multiple platforms and environments.

Plan:

1. Systematic Node Interface Compliance
   - Review all node classes (platform, filesystem, browser, AI, language nodes).
   - Ensure each node fully implements the BaseNode interface, including:
     * 'input' property with appropriate typing (e.g., ContextEnvelope<any>).
     * 'process' method returning a Promise of the output type.
   - Remove or simplify complex generic Promise constructor syntax to avoid TS1110 errors.

2. Node Logic Enhancement
   - Review and improve node logic to ensure effective operation of their respective platforms.
   - Add missing logic or methods as needed to support full functionality.
   - Ensure consistent error handling and asynchronous operation patterns.

3. TypeScript Typing and Syntax Simplification
   - Avoid explicit generic types in Promise constructors where possible.
   - Use async/await syntax for asynchronous methods to improve readability and reduce errors.
   - Verify all files have correct .ts extensions (not .tsx) to avoid JSX parsing conflicts.

4. Centralized Type Exports and Index Files
   - Create index.ts files to centralize exports of node classes and interfaces.
   - Simplify import paths and reduce import-related errors.

5. Testing and Validation
   - After refactoring, perform critical-path testing on:
     * Node execution and registration.
     * Orchestrator integration.
     * mCP connector and adapter communication.
     * Security engine and quantum processor functionality.
   - Iterate improvements based on test results.

6. Documentation and Maintenance
   - Update documentation to reflect refactored node system.
   - Maintain the updated plan as a reference for future development and onboarding.

This plan aligns with the vision to create a superhuman AI system capable of operating diverse platforms through a robust, type-safe, and maintainable node system.

Next Steps:
- Begin refactoring ios-node.ts and apply similar fixes to other node files.
- Enhance node logic as needed.
- Proceed with testing after refactor.

This document can be used as a motto or guiding principle for ongoing and future development.

End of Plan.
